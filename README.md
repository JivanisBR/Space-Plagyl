## About The Game

**SPACE PLAGYL** is a **Retro aesthetic Space Shooter** game, developed entirely in **C++** using only the **Raylib** framework.

The **Objective** is to destroy **10 meteors** without being hit, and then defeat the **final Boss**. After that, the game restarts, and your ship gains **+1 movement** and **shot speed** for each time you defeat the Boss.

It was implemented a **procedural stars and nebulas generation** with a **particles density choice**, to priorize **visuals**, **performance** or **equillibrium**.

This project was created by **Giovani Giachini** with the main goal of studying and applying **game logic** and **data structures** directly in code.
